Iris Dataset Clustering Assessment
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of clustering techniques on the Iris dataset using Python's sklearn library. The notebook implements two popular clustering algorithms:

1. KMeans Clustering
Description: KMeans clustering is an iterative algorithm that partitions the dataset into k clusters based on the mean of the data points within each cluster. It is widely used for its simplicity and efficiency, particularly when the number of clusters is known beforehand.
Reason for Suitability: KMeans is suitable for the Iris dataset due to its ability to efficiently cluster data points into distinct groups, given that the Iris dataset is well-structured and has clear natural groupings.
Implementation: The dataset is preprocessed, and KMeans is applied to identify clusters, followed by visualizing the clusters.
----

3. Hierarchical Clustering
Description: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) by progressively merging or splitting clusters. It does not require the number of clusters to be specified upfront and is useful when exploring data at different levels of granularity.
Reason for Suitability: Hierarchical clustering is suitable for the Iris dataset because it can reveal the nested structure of clusters, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the data.
Implementation: The dataset is preprocessed, and hierarchical clustering is applied, with the results visualized in a dendrogram.

-------

Key Features:
Preprocessing: The species column is dropped from the dataset, as clustering is an unsupervised technique that does not use target labels.
Visualization: After clustering, the data is visualized to show the clusters formed by both algorithms.
Clear Explanations: Detailed explanations accompany the implementation of both algorithms to aid understanding.
